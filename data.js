    aboutMe: `I'm not just bits and bytes, I'm a UX alchemist.\n\nI don't just design interfaces, I craft experiences. From streamlining email chaos in Gmail to weaving seamless travel plans in TripSync, I'm obsessed with turning pain points into "aha!" moments. Think of me as a problem-solving wizard, armed with Figma spells and user research incantations to conjure up intuitive, engaging tech that people actually love. âœ¨\n\nBut I'm not just a lone wolf in the UX wilderness. I lead, I inspire, I build bridges between tech and humans. As the UI/UX Head at ACM Thapar Patiala, I turned a small spark into a blazing fire, growing our community and igniting design passion in hundreds of students.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a UX designer who's not afraid to dive deep into user needs, unleash creative magic, and collaborate to build something truly groundbreaking, let's chat. Your digital dreams are my next potion to brew.`,
